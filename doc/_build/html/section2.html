<h1>Linear Regression<a class="headerlink" href="#linear-regression" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The second part of this work deals with the use of tools related to machine
learning: can we use the data to create models that will allows us to predict
the ridership?</p>
<p>Problem Set 3 of the class has as one of the main goals the use of a linear
regression model that could help us to predict the ridership in the NYC subway.
We were asked to implement one of the algorithms that calculates the coefficients
of a multiple linear regression model: gradient descent. The selection of the
features, and thus the number of coefficients to fit, was left as an exercise
for the student.</p>
<p>After implementing the linear regression model, and study its strengths and
shortcomings, we used another algorithm to find the coefficients of the linear
regression model: OLS, or ordinary least squares.</p>
<p>Finally, a third method was used, also based on a linear regression algorithm,
but this time the model used higher order polynomials to learn from the data,
in an effort to fit the non-linearity of it.</p>

<p>After analysing the results from the previous regressions, and for reasons that
will be clear after the description of their results, we went a little further
and we used a polynomial transformation of the selected features, and another
linear regression algorithm, the Ridge regression, was used to model the data
and predict ridership. The model used and results will be shown in the
interpretation section.</p>

<div class="section" id="models-and-features-used">
<h2>Models and features used<a class="headerlink" href="#models-and-features-used" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The selection of the features to use and how to use them in the model was not
a linear process, but an iterative work based on exploratory statistics, residuals
analysis and study of the models obtained to predict the ridership. If fact,
for the problem set 3 in the class we used a different set of variables as
predictors (specifically <cite>day_week</cite> instead of <cite>weekday</cite>).</p>
<p>Also, because of these iterative analysis we decided to also give a try to a
third method to model the data, which was the use of polynomial features.</p>
<p>The multiple regression model used for the first two methods can be written as:</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-multreg_mod">
<span id="multreg-mod"></span><span class="eqno">(1)</span>\[\hat y = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + theta_2 x_2 + ... + \theta_k x_k\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\hat y\)</span> is the predicted variable, <span class="math">\(x_i\)</span> are the predictors
(features) and <span class="math">\(\theta_i\)</span> are the coefficients or parameters that we are
looking for using either the gradient descent or the OLS algorithms.</p>
<p>For our work, we decided to use the following predictors:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><cite>UNIT</cite>: turnstile unique identification. The use of the identification
of each turnstile starts from the realization that the turnstiles have different
ridership volumes for the same time periods, as it can be readily seen by
comparing ridership averages. However this is a non-numerical categorical
variable, so it was required to transform this variable to numerical format
by using dummy variables. This steps adds at once <cite>n</cite> extra features or predictors,
one for each turnstile in our data, which adds a lot of computing work to the
algorithm.</li>
<li><cite>hour</cite>: numerical variable that indicates the hour of the day when the ridership
was reported for each turnstile. This variable takes values that can be continuous
between 0 and 24; it adds one coefficient to calculate. <a class="reference internal" href="#figure31"><em>Figure 3.1</em></a>
shows the relation of the ridership values with hour the day.</li>
</ul>
<div class="figure align-center" id="figure31">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/hour_rider.png"><img alt="_images/hour_rider.png" src="_images/hour_rider.png" style="width: 1440.0px; height: 720.0px;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Ridership vs hour of the day.</p>
<div class="legend">
Instead of just constructing a scatter plot, we decided to use another descriptive
statistic method to study the relation, if any, between ridership and hour of
the day. We used boxplots to visualize the distribution of ridership for each
hour of the day. In this way we can see that the medians do not follow a
linear relation with the hour of the day, and that there is a huge spread
of possible ridership values for each hour.</div>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><cite>weekday</cite>: numerical (and categorical) variable indicating if the day
when the ridership measurement was done was either a weekday (1) or weekend
day (0). <a class="reference internal" href="#figure32"><em>Figure 3.2</em></a>
shows the relation of the ridership with kind of day.</li>
</ul>
<div class="figure align-center" id="figure32">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/weekday_rider.png"><img alt="_images/weekday_rider.png" src="_images/weekday_rider.png" style="width: 1440.0px; height: 720.0px;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Ridership vs weekday/weekend-day.</p>
<div class="legend">
This plot show the ridership distribution as boxplots for work days (Monday to
Friday) and weekend days (Saturdays and Sundays). It is clear that even
when the spread in entries per hour is still big a linear correlation can
be used.</div>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><cite>rain</cite>: daily precipitation condition for a turnstile location (0 for a clear
day, 1 for rainy). Even when is a categorical variable, it is also numerical,
and it is used as the final predictor feature for our liner model.
<a class="reference internal" href="#figure33"><em>Figure 3.3</em></a> shows the relation of the ridership values with
precipitation conditions.</li>
</ul>
<div class="figure align-center" id="figure33">

<p class="caption">Ridership vs rainy conditions.</p>
<div class="legend">
With the use of boxplots again, we can see in this figure that a really mild
linear relation exist for the relation between daily precipitation conditions
and ridership. (Which as was shown in the previous section is not significant)</div>
</div>
<p>The features were selected based partially on intuition and partially by exploratory
analysis.</p>
<p>First, it was clear that the behavior, for each individual turnstile, was mainly
a function of the hour of the day and the day of the week, as is shown in
<a class="reference internal" href="#figure34"><em>Figure 3.4</em></a>: there is a clear periodicity in the ridership
behavior for each day, depending on the time of the day, and also a dependence
on the day of the week. However the relation is clearly non-linear. We kept the
<cite>hour</cite> as a predictor because is an important predictor, an in a very rough way
one can see that ridership is lower in the beginning of the day while reaching
a pick on the evenings.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="figure34">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/r084_may.png"><img alt="_images/r084_may.png" src="_images/r084_may.png" style="width: 936.0px; height: 360.0px;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Ridership vs date for turnstile R084.</p>
<div class="legend">
The figure clearly shows a periodic behavior for the ridership behavior for
a particular turnstile, which is a function mainly of the hour of the day and
day of the week. Ridership picks are usually seen at 20 hours, while weekends
and holidays (May 30th) being less busy than weekdays.</div>
</div>
<p>However, we decided to use <cite>weekday</cite> instead of <cite>day_week</cite> (the second being the
day of the week, i.e, a number between 0 and 6, where 0 i Monday and 6 Sunday),
because the major change on ridership behavior is seen between work days and
off days (weekends), and <cite>weekday</cite> can be better modeled by a linear model than
<cite>day_week</cite> (as it can be checked on <a class="reference internal" href="#figure35"><em>Figure 3.5</em></a>)</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="figure35">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/day_rider.png"><img alt="_images/day_rider.png" src="_images/day_rider.png" style="width: 1440.0px; height: 720.0px;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Ridership vs day of the week.</p>
<div class="legend">
This plot show the ridership distribution as boxplots for the 7 days of the
week (0 is Monday, 6 is Sunday). We can see that even when a relation
exist between day of the week and ridership, this relation doesn&#8217;t look
linear, and thus we decided to use <cite>weekday</cite> instead.</div>

<p>The coefficients found with the gradient descent and OLS algorithms were the
same in both cases, which was expected for a successful execution of the
gradient descent algorithm. The selected features were enough to obtain a
<span class="math">\(R^2 = 0.481\)</span>. More in depth details of the result can be seen in
<a class="reference internal" href="#table31"><em>Table 3.1</em></a>. Also, thanks to the statsmodels OLS implementation
we can report some of the coefficients obtained from the linear model fit,
