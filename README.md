Introduction to Data Science Project
------------------------------------

This is the github repository of Project 1 of the Data Analyst Nanodegree, by
Ignacio Toledo CÃ¡rcamo. The project report is found on the pdf file called
AnalyzintheNYCSubwayDataset.pdf, in the root directory of this
project.

The python code for the gradient descent and linear regression
is found on the file projectone.py

All the supporting python code and work done is available, with not too much
order, in the accompanying IPython notebook Project1.ipynb. To view a rendered
